# MONO - PHP FRAMEWORK

Mono is a Powerful and Fast, Object Oriented Based PHP Framework.
It follows the MVC architecture.
It comes with its own commandline interface.

## Serving the Project

#### Run command:

    php mono serve

or

    php mono -s

## Creating a Controller

#### Run command:

    php mono -g con <filename>

or

    php mono gen controller <filename>

or

    php mono generate controller <filename>

After running this command, a controller class snippet will be generated with
a default index route handler.

Routes are determined by the controllers defined inside the controllers folder.

Base routes are anchored to the name of the controller class.

example:

    controller: Home.php
    route: /home

## Creating a Middleware

#### Run command:

    php mono -g mid <filename>

or

    php mono gen middleware <filename>

or

    php mono generate middleware <filename>

After running this command, a new middleware class snippet will be
generated with a runnable method that would be executed once a middleware
is instanciated inside a middleware attribute.

example:

    <?php

    use App\Core\Middleware;

    class Auth extends Middleware
    {
        static function runnable(Request $request, callable $next)
        {
            echo 'Auth Middleware';

            return $next();
        }
    }

Use the $next() callable function to move to the next middleware
or controller.

You may return void, json(), view(), and redirect() in handling
bad requests or unauthenticated requests.

You may also use a native jwt token inside the middleware,
which is the recommended place for authentication and
authorization processes.

example with native jwt token:

    <?php

    use App\Core\Middleware;

    class Auth extends Middleware
    {
        static function runnable(Request $request, callable $next)
        {
            $jwt = $request->cookies['auth_token'] ?? "";

    	    $key = "sample_secret_key";

    	    $payload = Token::verify($jwt, $key);

    	    if (!$payload) {
    	    	return redirect('/login');
    	    }

    	    return $next();
        }
    }

#### Using Middlewares

To use a middleware, add an attribute on top of your target method
to which you wish to apply the middleware.

Create a new instance of your middleware inside the Middleware attribute
constructor.

example:

    <?php

    class Home extends Controller
    {
        #[Middleware(new Auth)]
        #[Route(method: 'GET')]
        public function index(Request $request)
        {
            return view('Home');
        }
    }

Middlewares may also be applied on the controller class itself.
This way, the middleware will be able to handle authentication
and authorization processes for the whole base route.

example:

    <?php

    #[Middleware(new Auth)]
    class Home extends Controller
    {
        #[Route(method: 'GET')]
        public function index(Request $request)
        {
            return view('Home');
        }
    }

## Creating a Model

#### Run command:

    php mono -g mod <filename>

or

    php mono gen model <filename>

or

    php mono generate model <filename>

After running this command, a model class snippet will be generated with default
id attribute and a commented static function that you need to configure
depending on your liking.

#### Generated example Model

    <?php

    class Product extends Model {
    private $id;
        public function __construct($id = null){

            $this->id = $id;

        self::createTable('id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY');
        }
    }

Use the self::createTable() method to create a new table.

The name of the model class will be automatically saved as
a table to the database.

Model class provides find, findById, update, and delete static methods.

example:

    User::find() will return all rows in the table

#### Getters and Setters Generation

You may automatically generate getters and setters for your model schema
by running the command:

    php mono -f <model name>

or

    php mono fill <model name>

example:

        php mono fill user

After running the command, getters and setters for all specified
attributes within the class will be generated automatically, as well as
the initialization of the attributes.

## Creating a View

#### Run command:

    mono -g vw <filename>

or

    mono gen view <filename>

or

    mono generate view <filename>

After running this command, a .view.php file will be generated with
default html snippet and an h1 tag with the file's name.

example view:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang='en'>

    <head>
        <meta charset='UTF-8'>
        <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'>
        <title>Home</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Mono</h1>
        <h3>The Fast, Scalable, Object-Oriented PHP Framework.</h3>
        <p>HELLO WORLD!</p>
    </body>

    </html>

You can return view( filename , [ options ] ) to pass data from your
controller. the keys in your options will be evaluated as a variable.

example:

controller:

    return view('Home', [ 'name' => 'John Doe' ]);

view:

    <p> <?= $name ?> </p>

## Creating a Service

#### Run command:

    php mono -g ser <filename>

or

    php mono gen ser <filename>

of

    php mono generate service <filename>

After running the command, a new service class will be generated with the
the same methods as the controller class but only static.

Controller class will be automatically created if a controller class
for the service is not yet created.

example:

    <?php

    class ProductsService
    {
        static function index(Request $request)
        {
            $product = [
                'name' => 'Brandyy',
                'brand' => 'Brand X',
                'expiration' => 'November 23, 2030'
            ];

            return json([
                'product' => $product
            ]);
        }
    }

usage:

    <?php

    class Products extends Controller
    {

    #[Route(method: 'GET')]
    public function index(Request $request)
        {
            return ProductsService::index($request);
        }
    }

Using services can be efficient when the logic is too complex.

Services separates the logic from route handling for better
code refactoring and better code structuring.

Using services will help your code to be more organized and
readable.

## Routing with Mono

Routes are determined by the controller classes inside the controllers folder.

Base routes are named after the file name of the controller.

example:

    controller: Users.php
    route: /users

By default, Home.php or /home refers to the root path.

Mono would recognize a controller with Home.php filename as the root controller.
hence, / is the same as /home.

## Nested Routes

Nested routes are routes added after the base route.

example:

    /users/profile

where profile is the nested route.

In Mono, to create a nested route handler,
you have to create a controller class and another function
with Route attribute on the top.

example implementation:

    <?php

    class Users extends Controller {

        #[Route(method: 'GET')]
        public function index(Request $request){

            return 'Users controller';
        }

        #[Route(path: "/profile", method: "GET")]
        public function index(Request $request){

            return 'this is the profile route handler';
        }
    }

#### explanation:

In creating a route handler, you need to specify its Route attribute
--- the route path and method.

By default, path is pointing at the name of the controller class,
thus, you only need to add the specified path like '/profile' to the path.

path result:

    /users/profile

## Dynamic Routes

Dynamic routes in Mono are the same with other frameworks.
You need to add a semicolon at the beginning of the route.

example:

    /users/:id

id route will be dynamic and can contain dynamic values.

example implementation:

    <?php

    class Users extends Controller {

        #[Route(method: 'GET')]
        public function index(Request $request){

            return 'Users controller';
        }

        #[Route(path: "/:id", method: "GET")]
        public function index(Request $request){

            return 'id = ' . $request->param["id"];
        }
    }

If a route includes an specified :id,
the route handler will run regardless of the value being passed into the :id.

example:

    users/12
    users/11
    users/7

    id = 12
    id = 11
    id = 7

## Parsing Dynamic Route Param

To parse the route parameter in Mono, you need to access
the $request parameter that's availble to you.

The request object $request includes various data and
one of those data is the route param.

#### accessing the value:

The value is within the $request object in param array.
To access the value, simply specify the name of the parameter.

example:

    path: /users/:id

accessing:

    $request->param["id"]

## Query Parameters in Mono

Query parameters can be found within the $request object
provided by mono function handlers.

To access the value of the query parameter, simply specify the query key.

example:

path:

    /users?id=12

query parameter:

    $request->query["id"]

## Request Methods in Mono

You can specify the request methods in the Route attribute
located on top of the route function handlers.

example:

    #[Route(method: "POST")]

Request methods may include GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE.
Routes with the same path but different request methods will be
treated and handled differently.

## The Route Attribute

Route attributes are similar to annotations in other programming languages.

The route attribute determines the path, as well
as the method a route handler will be handling.

example:

    <?php

    class Home extends Controller
    {
        #[Route(method: 'GET')]
        public function index(Request $request)
        {
            return view("Home");
        }
    }

In this example, the route handler function named 'index' has an attribute
of Route with the path poiting at home and a request method of GET.

The function will only run if the route path given matches the request url.

## Views in Mono Framework

Mono provides a way to render a view or an HTML template inside PHP.
Views file have an extension of .view.php
Views file can be returned by the controller route handler functions.
Views contains all the HTML tags and templates being rendered by the server.

#### Returning a View

    <?php

    class Home extends Controller
    {
        #[Route(method: 'GET')]
        public function index(Request $request)
        {
            return view("Home");
        }
    }

To return a view, simply call the view() function and
specify the filename of the .view.php file as the first argument.

#### Returning a View with Argument

    <?php

    class Home extends Controller
    {
        #[Route(method: 'GET')]
        public function index(Request $request)
        {
            return view("Home", [
                "name" => "KENDRICK"
            ]);
        }
    }

You can add a second argument to the view() function as an
associative array to pass in data from the controller to the view.

example:

Controller:

    #[Route(method: 'GET')]
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        return view("Home", [
            "name" => "KENDRICK"
        ]);
    }

View:

    <h1> <?= $name ?> </h1>

If you pass in a value as the second argument in the view() function,
the value can be accessed within a variable with the same naming convention as your key in the associated array options that you've passed.

## Models in Mono

Model classes are blueprints of a database table.

Model classes can have columns specified in your database table.

The name of the model class represents the name of the table inside your database.

For example:

    User.php refers to the user table inside your database.

Model classes also provides built in static functions that
you can use to read, create, update, and delete data inside your database.

## Model Class Methods

Model class methods includes:

- create()
- delete()
- update()
- find()
- findById()
- query()
- createTable()
- initModels()

## CreateTable Method in Mono

The createTable() method is used to initialize and configure your database table.

You can specify the name, type, and other configurations of your columns
by using this method.

Note that createTable() method will only create a new table if it is not yet created.

example implementation:

    <?php

    class User extends Model
    {
        public $id, $username, $password;

        public function __construct($id = null, $username = null, $password = null)
        {

            $this->id = $id;
            $this->username = $username;
            $this->password = $password;

            self::createTable("
                id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
                username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
                password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
            ");
        }
    }

## Create() Method

The create() method provided by the Model class creates and saves
a new Model to the database table.

example implementation:

    $new_user = new User(
        username: "zornnn",
        password: "zorn123456"
    );

    User::create($new_user);

The create() method accepts a User object with the same type.
It then creates a new row and saves the newly created row into the table.

Syntax:

    Model::create(new Model(...))

The create() method returns a boolean value,
which then can be used to handle invalid inputs and failed creation.

Hence, should be:

    $new_user = new User(
        username: "zornnn",
        password: "zorn123456"
    );

    $isCreated = User::create($new_user);

    if ($isCreated){
        return 'new user is created';
    } else {
        return 'failed to create new user';
    }

## Find() and FindById() Methods

For each model schema you create, you will have access to find()
and findById() methods.

find() method is used to get all of the data from your table.

Mono will automatically assume and use the name of your model
schema class as the table name inside your database.

example:

Model schema class name:

    User

Database table name:

    users

example implementations:

For this example, assume that you have a model User inside your
models folder.

##### findById() implementation

example:

    $users = User::find();

the find() method returns an array of User objects, hence
each element posesses the properties and methods you have specified
inside the User model class, such as the getters and setters.

##### findById() implementation

For this example, assume again that you have a model user inside
your models folder.

example:

        $user = User::findById( id: 1 );

findById() method takes and int $id parameter to find specific data
by its id attribute in the database.

findById() method returns an object of the model class that
issued the method.

In this example, findById() returns an object instance of User.
All public attributes and methods inside the User model class will
be accessible in the object returned by this method.

## Update() method

The update method lets you update a specific data in your database
table.

It takes one argument, your model object, and updates the data
by its id.

The $id attribute is important in this method for targeting the
right data in your database table.

In this example, assume that you have a model class User with
attributes $id, $username, and $password

example:

    $user = User::findById( id: 1 );

    $user->setUsername('new_sername_example');

    User::update($user);

The update method returns a boolean value which you can use
to stuffs like checking if the operation was successfull.

example:

    $user = User::findById( id: 1 );

    $user->setUsername('new_sername_example');

    $is_updated = User::update($user);

    if ($is_updated) {
        return 'user updated successfully';
    }

## Delete() method

The delete() method lets you delete and remove specific data from
your database table.

The delete() method takes one argument, either an object or an integer
variable.

Using integer as an argument will speed up the process of deleting.

The delete() method returns a boolean value which you can use to check
if the operation was successful.

example:

    $is_deleted = User::delete( target: 1 );

    if ($is_deleted) {
        return 'user deleted successfully';
    }

or

    $user = User::findById( id: 1 );

    $is_deleted = User::delete($user);

    if ($is_deleted) {
        return 'user deleted successfully';
    }
